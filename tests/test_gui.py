"""The window's own decisions, tested without opening one.

A Tk window driven from pytest hangs on macOS -- reliably, at the second test --
though the same sequence runs clean as a plain script. A suite that hangs is
worse than one that covers a little less, so the logic that must not be wrong
lives in module-level functions here rather than inside the widget, and the
widget wiring is checked by running `make run-demo`.

What is tested is what would mislead the operator: the stop button saying which
of the two things it will do, the option parsing that decides what the scanner
is asked for, and the resolution guard.
